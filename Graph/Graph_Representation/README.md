Adjacency List:
An array of lists is used. Size of the array is equal to the number of vertices. 
Let the array be array[]. An entry array[i] represents the list of vertices adjacent to the ith vertex. 
This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. 
The weights of edges can be represented as lists of pairs. 
Following is adjacency list representation of the above graph.
